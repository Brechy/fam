# Fam Web App
A community Web-App built by Galvanize WDI students as a Q2 project.

Everyone needs a community. Build yours using the Fam Web App. Connect with other parents in your area, lend a helping hand to a new mom in need of a little house cleaning or a meal. Ask for help from local parents to come walk your dog or just chat with you because it can be pretty isolating being a stay at home parent.
